    <h3>The Prestige</h3>
    
    <p>Set in London in the 1800s, two rival magicians read each others diary containing 
        the secrets of their magic tricks and personal life. As we go back in time when 
        the diaries were written, both magicians become obsessed with their rival's best trick. 
        The tricks, as shown to the audience, look the same, but neither magician can figure 
        out how his opponent does it.</p>
    
    <h3>The Departed</h3>
    
    <p>In this crime-action tour de force, the South Boston state police force is waging war 
        on Irish-American organized crime. Young undercover cop Billy Costigan is assigned to 
        infiltrate the mob syndicate run by gangland chief Frank Costello. While Billy quickly
         gains Costello's confidence, Colin Sullivan, a hardened young criminal who has infiltrated
          the state police as an informer for the syndicate, is rising to a position of power in the
           Special Investigation Unit. Each man becomes deeply consumed by their double lives, 
           gathering information about the plans and counter-plans of the operations they have 
           penetrated. But when it becomes clear to both the mob and the police that there is a 
           mole in their midst, Billy and Colin are suddenly in danger of being caught and exposed 
           to the enemy</p>
    
    <h3>Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story</h3>
    
    <p>The up-and-down-and-up-again story of musician Dewey Cox, 
        whose songs would change a nation. On his rock 'n roll spiral, 
        Cox sleeps with 411 women, marries three times, has 36 kids, stars in
         his own 70s TV show, collects friends ranging from Elvis to the Beatles
          to a chimp, and gets addicted to - and then kicks - every drug known to
           man; but despite it all, Cox grows into a national icon and eventually
            earns the love of a good woman - longtime backup singer Darlene.</p>
