    <!-- Short bio info -->
    <p>I'm a passionate computer engineer with a solid background in electrical and computer engineering. I’ve worked on
      research, design, and app development, and my experience in a European-funded Innovative Training Network project 
      sharpened my technical skills and critical thinking.
      My research on 5G networks, which are revolutionizing many sectors, led me to pursue a career in IT systems. I started
      at Epic, handling network planning, design, and equipment maintenance, and helped create 5G and VoLTE services.
      Later, I joined Kyndryl (formerly IBM) as a Network and Security Specialist, gaining hands-on experience with IBM, 
      Cisco, Fortinet, and Checkpoint products. Now, I’m with the Department of IT Services of the Republic of Cyprus, 
      working on projects to modernize and digitize public services.</p>
